# Getting Started with Create React App

npm i react-router-dom
npm install cra-template-redux-typescript
npm i react-redux
npm i @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
npm i @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

### `npm run dev` wont work because of "cra(create-react-app)" - `npm install cra-template-redux-typescript`
